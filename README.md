# CassetteAdapter
CassetteAdapter is a simple adapter that allows connecting any audio source to the Datassette port of a Commodore VIC-20, 64, 128 or Plus/4 computer.

## Summary
With this adapter, any audio source can be used in place of the proprietary Commodore Datassette, in order to load software into a Commodore computer through the dedicated port.

This project is similar to [MP32C64](https://github.com/SukkoPera/MP32C64) but it is implemented in a slightly different way, with a real opamp for the initial signal amplification. 

It seems to have been originally developed by ZX_Jim, probably inspired by a similar adapter for the ZX Spectrum, which he might have actually developed himself.

In my experience this adapter works just as well as the other one: beside Audio CDs, MP3 files will also work, so a smartphone (provided that you have an old model with an audio jack...) or any other audio player can be used.

PRG files can be converted to audio using the [WAV-PRG](https://wav-prg.sourceforge.io) software suite.

## Assembly
The adapter can either be built with a PJRAN1X1U01X RCA/Cinch connector or with a SJ1-3525N 3.5" headphone jack connector, according to your preference. Note that the RCA connector will point towards the back, while the headphone jack will point to the right.

## Usage
Usage should be straightforward. The only thing to be careful with is the playback volume: start with 0 and gradually increase it until the Signal LED is constantly on. You can still go up a few ticks from there, experiment a bit until you have successful loads.

If the audio player you are using has a volume knob, set the onboard volume control to the maximum and do the above with the knob on the player.

## Releases
If you want to get this board produced, you are recommended to get [the latest release](https://github.com/SukkoPera/CassetteAdapter/releases) rather than the current git version, as the latter might be under development and is not guaranteed to be working.

Every release is accompanied by its Bill Of Materials (BOM) file and any relevant notes about it, which you are recommended to read carefully.
